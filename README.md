Python 3.5 script to search cheapest flights using Google QPX Express API

### Warning: Still early alpha version
Latest progress: successful querry of the google api. Output still messy unformatted json.

Requires a file with your api key in the root directory of the script. The filename has to be changed within the code (variable keyfile). Default is "key1.txt".
